# sunfounder-lessons-remastered
Arduino code from Sunfounder lessons converted into more legible code

In this project I intend on converting all the lessons from Sunfounder's "Super Kit V3.0 for Arduino" into more legible code
for the use of beginners to more easily learn how to program and use an Arduino

All of the circuit layouts can be found on Autodesk Tinkercad under these links
